Principal component analysis (PCA) and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are two of
the most widely used unsupervised methods in machine learning. In this assignment, PCA is used for dimensionality reduction and EM algorithm is applied for Gaussian mixture model to
cluster the data with dimensionality reduced.
