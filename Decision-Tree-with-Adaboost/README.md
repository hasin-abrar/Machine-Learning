Decision tree is one of the models extensively used in classification problems. In ensemble
learning, we combine decisions from multiple weak learners to solve a classification problem. In
this assignment I have implemented a decision tree classifier and use it within AdaBoost algorithm.

The performance and the efficiency of the implementation are demonstrated for the following
three different datasets.
